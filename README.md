This repository presents new model for storing 2d data of any type in Python.
Inspired by Pandas.


## Tests

To run tests use command ```nosetests tests``` from the root folder.
If anything is broken, exception will be raised else "OK' is written.

## Requirements

You only need `Pandas` and `numpy` packages to be installed.
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or just install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
