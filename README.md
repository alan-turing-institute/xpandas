**XPandas** (extended [`Pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/)) implements 1D and 2D data containers for storing type-heterogeneous tabular data of any type, 
and encapsulates feature extraction and transformation modelling in an sklearn-compatible transformer interface.

## Quickstart

Install the latest version

    $ pip install xpandas
    
and run the example jupyter notebook
    
    $ jupyter examples/ExampleUsage.ipynb

- **Bernd Bischl (@berndbischl)**, who mentioned the idea of a general data container with transformers attached to columns in personal discussion with Franz Kiraly during a London visit in 2016.
- **Franz Kiraly (@fkiraly)**, who initiated and funded the project up to release, and who substantially contributed to the API design.
- **Haoran Xue (@HaoranXue)**, who, under the supervision of Franz Kiraly, earlier completed a thesis for a degree at UCL on the topic, and who wrote a similar package as part of it. No code was re-used in the creation of the XPandas package.
